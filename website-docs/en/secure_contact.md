You might need to get in touch with the teams with things being very hush-hush, so much that you won't even trust classical means of contact, such as the Discord. Or might think that Discord is evil because is managed by an evil startup in san francisco that puts botnets everywhere. Well, if that's the case, you can contact us by good ol' emails. Fire up that email client, and compose a new email to either **night@atoka.pw** or **phil@atoka.pw** if you wish to contact the developers, **support@atoka.pw** for any other inquiry. Please note Night and Phil don't and can't handle anything related to bans and anything to deal with your account. Technical problems only.
