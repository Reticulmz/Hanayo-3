Atoka has a few bots you can contact in-game that can do some awesome things! Here's a list of some of those, to get started, contact them in game. If you're interested in adapting your bot to Atoka, feel free to do it! If you want to get a bot account, contact [support](mailto:support@atoka.pw). If you want to add a bot to this list, contact [Night](mailto:night@atoka.pw), either via email or through Discord.
