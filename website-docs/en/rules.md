<h3><i class="shield icon"></i>Moderation Policy</h3>

Unlike other infractions, we have a fixed moderation policy for hacking rules. If you are caught breaking those rules, your account will be wiped. It means all your scores will be deleted. You will also get one strike.

If you get wiped again, you will have 2 strikes, which means your account will be restricted as that is our limit.

You may appeal 1 month after your restriction, if you think you were restricted for an unjust reason, you may send us an email.

If you want to appeal, you may email us at [support@atoka.pw](mailto:support@atoka.pw).
